Nous avons recueilli les descriptions des diff√©rentes variables dans le document https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4461/eff4577b9a378d5cbd2df59840066e356e92.pdf


Vocal Feature | Description|
--- | --- |
Jitter(%) | Average absolute difference between consecutive periods, divided by the average period. 
Jitter(Abs) | Average absolute difference between consecutive periods which gives information about the cycle-to-cycle variation of fundamental frequency given in seconds. | 283 |
Jitter:RAP | Relative Average Perturbation (RAP), which is the average absolute difference between a period and the average of it and its two neighbours, divided by the average period. |
Jitter:PPQ5 | Five-point Period Perturbation Quotient, computed as the average absolute difference between a period and the average of it and its four closest neighbours, divided by the average period. |
Jitter:DDP | Average absolute difference between consecutive differences between consecutive periods, divided by the average period. |
Shimmer | Average absolute difference between the amplitudes of consecutive periods, divided by the average amplitude. |
Shimmer(dB) | Average absolute base-10 logarithm of the difference between the amplitudes of consecutive periods, multiplied by 20. It gives information about the variability of the peak-to-peak amplitude in decibels. | 
Shimmer:APQ3 | Three-point Amplitude Perturbation Quotient, the average absolute difference between the amplitude of a period and the average of the amplitudes of its neighbours, divided by the average amplitude. | 
Shimmer:APQ5 | Five-point Amplitude Perturbation Quotient, the average absolute difference between the amplitude of a period and the average of the amplitudes of it and its four closest neighbours, divided by the average amplitude. | 
Shimmer:APQ11 | 11-point Amplitude Perturbation Quotient, the average absolute difference between the amplitude of a period and the average of the amplitudes of it and its ten closest neighbours, divided by the average amplitude. | 
Shimmer:DDA | Average absolute difference between consecutive differences between the amplitudes of consecutive periods. |
Noise to Harmonics Ratio (NHR) | Amplitude of noise relative to tonal components. It quantifies the noise which occurs due to turbulent airflow, resulting from incomplete vocal fold closure in speech pathologies. | 
Harmonics to Noise Ratio | Amplitude of tonal relative to noise components. It has the same aim as NHR |
Recurrence period density entropy | Addresses the ability of the vocal folds to sustain stable vocal fold vibrations,quantifying the deviations from exact periodicity |
Detrended fluctuation analysis | Quantifies the self-similarity of the noise present in the speech caused by the turbulent air flow |
Pitch period entropy| Measures the impaired control of stable pitch during sustained phonations |
